      History of the Company
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pat started this company about five years ago working 
      in a little shop that he owned downtown at the corner 
      of 1st and Pike. After being a great success, Pat 
      decided to branch out and make more bakeries for 
      his interesting cookies. He has set up bakeries in the 
      SeaTac Airport, Seattle Center, Capitol Hill and Alki.
